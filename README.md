# Binary Things
some algorithmic implementations of common questions about binary search, balanced trees and such.

# Why?

I got my degree on CS around 7 years ago. even tho my work has been about designing experiences around Frontend, Backend, API's even databases some problems like a binary search or how to balance a binary tree were things I never got asked or even had to solve again. Every tooling or framework would do this for me. or even easier, I would read the implementation and re implement them in whatever the environment/language I was using at the time.

# So why do we need this again?

We _might_ need it to solve some interview questions, perhaps it would come handy if we need to fix something that is not working properly (and the c&p doesn't _cut_ it anymore) or even just to refresh and learn some engrained algorithmic trickery in every _grep_ _find_ or even _search_ command/button we have used or cliked on!

# How?

Using JS when possible and English to the best of my ability.
Probably with MD files along with the code and some tests showing that the code works.


# list of algorithms

 - Binary Seach
 - Balancing a Binary Search Tree
 - Dynamic programming
 - BFS
 - Big O notation:
  - It tells you how fast a function grows or declines.
  - The letter O (not 0) is used because the rate of growth of a function is also called its order.
  - more explained: http://web.mit.edu/16.070/www/lecture/big_o.pdf
 - depth-first
 - breadth-first.
